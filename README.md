# DiceGame

First time coding in Java - A dice game

The game has two die. One die has 6 sides, while the user determines how many sides the other has.
The user is given $3 if the total is less than 5 and $8 if the total is equal to 5. If the total is more than 5, the user loses \$2.

First, the user is asked a series of questions and the responses are stored.

1. How many sides should the second die have
2. How many times should the die be rolled
3. How often should the results be printed
4. What is the users name

Then, the dice are then rolled and the results are printed.
